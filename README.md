# Titanic Survival prediction with 20 Algorithm :

Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning is a tool that uses data to guess if passengers survived the Titanic sinking. It looks at factors like age, gender, and ticket class to make its guesses. The goal is to understand what influenced survival rates on the ship.


## This Project aims to:

* Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
* Build various ML models that can predict survivors of titanic passenger
